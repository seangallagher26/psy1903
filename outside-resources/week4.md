# Outside Resources Log - Week 4

## AI Prompts

_Record any questions/prompts you put into an AI program this week to help with material in this course. You do not have to include the AI response, just your prompt. If you did not use AI this week, simply note "None"_

why is this code returning the whole array and not just odd numbers?

```js
function getOddNumbers(numbers) {
    let results = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
        if (numbers % 2 != 0) {
            results[results.length] = numbers;
        }
    }
    return results;
}
```
why is my data not showing up in this object? 
```js
    return data.push {
    number: num1,
    response: response,
    correct: answer,
    responseTime: responseTime
}

console.log(getOddNumbers([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))
```

## Outside sites

_Link any outside sites you referenced this week. You should exclude any resources/links that were provided in the course material. If you did not use any outside resources this week, simply note "None"_
